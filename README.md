 * These structures control movie stocking, customer accounts, and customer commands.
 *
 * Initialization requires three files, which are listed in Blockbuster.cpp at lines 31, 35, 39.
 * data4movies.txt should detail the initial stocking of the Blockbuster movie database.
 * data4customers.txt should detail the initial customer accounts registered with Blockbuster.
 * data4commands.txt should detail the list of commands to be executed by the Blockbuster automation program.
 * Detailed syntax for these files can be found in assignment4.doc.
 *
 * Blockbuster's constructor automatically initializes the Blockbuster with these files.
 * activateCommands() will run through the commands database and execute them as specified in assignment4.doc.
 * Additional commands, printMovies();, printCustomers(); and printCommands(); are provided to read from the database.
 * All other functions are to aid with the initialization or execution process.
